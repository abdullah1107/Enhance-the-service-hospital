A friend is someone who gives you total freedom to be yourself ..

Depth of friendship does not depend on length of acquaintance..(for sagor)

Friendship consists in forgetting what one gives and remembering what one receives.

Friendship is like money, easier make than kept..

friendship marks a life even more deeply than love.Love risks degenerating into obsession,friendship is never anything but sharing.

Lay this untoyour breast old friends,like old swords,still are trusted best ..

A true friend is one who knows all about you and likes you anyway ..

Everyone listen what you say.Friend listen what you say.Best friend listen to what you don't say .

Friends are those rare people who ask how you are and then wait to hear the answer .

Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking along in the light..

True friends are very difficult to find,Hard to leave,And impossible to foeget ..
